  description:
    "Box is our design systems most low-level atomic layout component. If youâ€™re unable to satisfy a design using the built-in set of higher level components, ODS also provides consumers with the Box component that provides direct access to the themed atomic styles that ODS uses internally. A nice side-effect of this approach is that your application will be reusing existing CSS rules rather than generating new ones, keeping your bundle size to a minimum.",
