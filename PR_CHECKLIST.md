# Submitting a pull request

The component library is a collaborative effort, so pull requests are always welcome, but, before working
on a large change, please discuss it with the ods core team.

A PR needs to be approved by at least 2 members of the ODS core team.

The table below is the checklist that needs to be all met before a PR is ready to merge:

|     | Checklist                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1   | Choose the right package for new components                              | Always have a chat with the ODS core team to find out where your code should go to.<br> Except the `ods-core` package, we are aiming for smaller feature focused packages whenever we can. However, creating it and the naming of the package must be confirmed by the **ODS core team**.                                                                                           |
| 2   | Feature branch follows the naming convention                             | The feature branch should always start with **ODS-XXX** where ODS-XXX is the story number of the corresponding JIRA card in ODS backlog. <br> If there is no JIRA card, create it first.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | Raise PR against **master** branch                                       | **master** is the branch we publish the release versions from (we use semantic release).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | Keep your PR short                                                       | Don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.<br> We consider large PR's as an exception. If you think it is inevitable have a chat with the core team.                                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | The code has unit tests covering all branches                            | If your component is an atomic visual component you can use snapshots, but it must cover all different renderings the component might have (based on different prop/state values). <br>Avoid large snapshots as they are not useful and it won't be approved. <br>Use practices recommended by `@testing-library`. <br> Use the utilities we provided in our `ods-testing-library`. |
| 6   | If component is visual include screenshots or link to the Zeplin designs |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
