# Code of conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to
making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the whole Origin Digital team
-   Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

-   The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

General maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to
take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

General maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
docs, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Resolution of conflicts of interests

The contribution guideline is the main source of truth in case of any disagreement or conflict of interests.
We hope it could resolve majority of disagreements.

In a rare case of a contributor disagreeing with a package owner please raise it to a general maintainer
for resolution.

If a concern is raised via a contributor, the contacted general maintainer is expected to bring up the matter
to the general maintainers group. The group then make a decision on the matter collaboratively. If the case could
be generalised the maintainers group should then update the contribution guidelines to address the issue in future.
